Tool Name: FeatureDetectionSIFT

Tool Description: 
Detects existing keypoints(features) and descriptors in images using the feature detector 
SIFT. This Feature Detector is used when accurate and robust feature detection with
detailed description generation based algorithms are the priority. When specified directly 
for SIFT or when classical based feature detection is called for with robust detection required
utilize the SIFT feature detector module. 

Initialization Parameters: 
- image_path (str): the image path in which the images are stored and to utilize for scene building
- max_keypoints: Maximum number of Keypoints to detect per image from the feature detector
    - Default (int): 1024
- n_octave_threshold: The number of layers in each octave. The number of octaves is computed automatically 
from the image resolution.
    - Default (int): 3 (NOTE: 3 is the value used in D. Lowe paper)
- contrast_threshold: The contrast threshold used to filter out weak features in semi-uniform (low-contrast) regions. 
The larger the threshold, the less features are produced by the detector. NOTE: The contrast threshold will be divided 
by nOctaveLayers when the filtering is applied.
    - Default (flaot): 0.04
- edgeThreshold: The threshold used to filter out edge-like features. Note that the its meaning is different from the 
contrastThreshold, i.e. the larger the edgeThreshold, the less features are filtered out (more features are retained).
    - Default (int): 10
- sigma: The sigma of the Gaussian applied to the input image at the octave #0. If your image is captured with a weak 
camera with soft lenses, you might want to reduce the number. 
    - Default (float): 1.6
- image_reshape: shape of image in the format of (int, int) = (Height, Width) to reshape current image to.
    - Default (int, int): None (No Reshape takes place by default)

Module Output: 
    list[Points2D]:
        Points2D (Detected Features per Scene):
            points2D:       [N x 2] np.float32
            descriptors:    [N x 128] np.float32
            scores:         [N x 1] np.float32
            image_size:     [1 x 2] np.int64


Tool Example: 
Initialization of Module: 
feature_detector = FeatureDetectionSIFT(image_path=image_path, max_keypoints = 2000) 

Function call of Module:  
features = feature_detector()

Tool Name: FeatureDetectionORB

Tool Description: 
Detects existing keypoints(features) and descriptors in images using the feature detector 
ORB. This Feature Detector is used when efficiency is the priority as ORB utilizes faster feature detection
and description generation based algorithms. When specified directly for ORB or when quick/efficient 
feature detection is necessary, and called for, utilize the ORB feature detector module. 

Initialization Parameters: 
- image_list (Images): a Python class in which the images are stored and to utilize for scene building
- max_keypoints: Maximum number of Keypoints to detect per image from the feature detector
    - Default (int): 1024
- edge_threshold: This is size of the border where the features are not detected. It should roughly match the patchSize parameter
- WTA_K: The number of points that produce each element of the oriented BRIEF descriptor.
- fast_threshold: This is the value to determine the pixel threshold for brightness, or dimness, that is used to estimate a point is a corner.
- image_reshape: shape of image in the format of (int, int) = (Height, Width) to reshape current image to.
    - Default (int, int): None (No Reshape takes place by default)

Module Output: 
    list[Points2D]:
        Points2D (Detected Features per Scene):
            points2D: [N x 2] np.float32
            descriptors: [N x 32] np.uint8
            scores:         [N x 1] np.float32
            image_size: [1 x 2] np.int64


Tool Example: 
Initialization of Module: 
image_reader = ImageProcessor(image_path=image_path)
images = image_reader(calibration_data)

feature_detector = FeatureDetectionORB(image_list=images, max_keypoints = 2000) 

Function call of Module:  
features = feature_detector()

Tool Name: FeatureDetectionSP

Tool Description: 
Detects existing keypoints(features) and descriptors in images using a Deep Learning Model Feature
Detector denoted as SuperPoint.
This Feature Detector is utilized in cases where diffuse lighting materials exist in scenes, images of 
environments that lack texture, or extreme view changes exist in scene video or images.
When specified directly to use the SuperPoint algorithm, mentioning to use a feature detector 
to handle view changes or material that lack texture in a given scene, or accurate dense features 
are necessary, use the SuperPoint detection Module.

Initialization Parameters: 
- image_path (str): the image path in which the images are stored and to utilize for scene building
- max_keypoints: Maximum number of Keypoints to detect per image from the feature detector
    - Default (int): 1024
- image_reshape: shape of image in the format of (int, int) = (Height, Width) to reshape current image to.
    - Default (int, int): None (No Reshape takes place by default)

Module Output: 
    list[Points2D]:
        Points2D (Detected Features per Scene):
            points2D: [N x 2] np.float32
            descriptors: [N x 256] np.float32
            scores:         [N x 1] np.float32
            image_size: [1 x 2] np.int64


Tool Example: 
Initialization: 
# Reshape Image
feature_detector = FeatureDetectionSP(image_path=image_path, max_keypoints=2000, image_reshape=(480, 640)) 

# Keep image size
feature_detector = FeatureDetectionSP(image_path=image_path, max_keypoints=2000) 

Function call:  
features = feature_detector()
