Tool Name: FeatureMatchFlannTracking

Tool Description: 
Detects point correspondance across multiple frames to track features. The feature matching
algorithm used is the Flann feature detector. Unless specified directly, assume the features
are detected using the SIFT algorithm and initialize through the detector parameter. 
Other supported detectors are: SIFT, ORB, SuperPoint, and FAST.

SuperPoint and Sift share the same parameters, whereas ORB and FAST share the same parameters.

Use this module in the case a faster feature matcher is needed for tracking features, in which
this module utilizes a nearest neighbor method for fast matching.

Initialization Parameters: 
- detector: String representing the name of the feature detector used for the features provided.
    - Default (str): SIFT
    
Function Call Parameters:
- features: list of features detected per scene estimated from the feature detection module


Tool Example: 
Initialization: 
# Determine the detector that was used previously and initialize module with said detector

# Feature Tracker Module initialized with the SIFT detector
feature_tracker = FeatureMatchFlannTracking(detector='sift') # Initialized with detector 'sift' for proper matching

# Feature Tracker Module initialized with the ORB detector 
feature_tracker = FeatureMatchFlannTracking(detector='orb') # Initialized with detector 'orb' for proper matching

# Feature Tracker Module intialized with the FAST detector
feature_tracker = FeatureMatchFlannTracking(detector='fast') # Initialized with detector 'orb' for proper matching

Example Usage in Script:  
features = feature_detector() # Call Feature Detector Module on image frames

tracked_features = feature_tracker(features=features) # Features used from Feature Detector Module are input to feature module

Tool Name: FeatureMatchLightGlueTracking

Tool Description: 
Detects point correspondance across multiple frames to track features for multi-view purposes. 
The feature matching algorithm used is the LightGlue deep learning model trained as a feature 
matcher. Unless specified directly, assume the features are detected using the SuperPoint 
deep learning feature detector algorithm and initialized with the detector parameter. 
Use this matching module when features need to be matched in images where the scene contains 
low-lit enviornment or illumination changes occur in the scene (Outdoors for example), 
and faster run time is REQUIRED, or when specified directly in this scenario.

Other supported detectors are: SIFT and SuperPoint

Initialization Parameters:

- n_layers: Number of stacked self+cross attention layers. Reduce this value for faster inference 
at the cost of accuracy (continuous red line in the plot above). 
    - Default (int): 9 (all layers).

- flash: Enable FlashAttention. Significantly increases the speed and reduces the memory consumption 
without any impact on accuracy. 
    - Default (bool): True (LightGlue automatically detects if FlashAttention is available).

- mp: Enable mixed precision inference. 
    - Default (bool): False (off)

- depth_confidence: Controls the early stopping. A lower values stops more often at earlier layers. 
    - Default (float): 0.95, disable with -1.

- width_confidence: Controls the iterative point pruning. A lower value prunes more points earlier. 
    - Default (float): 0.99, disable with -1.

- filter_threshold: Match confidence. Increase this value to obtain less, but stronger matches. 
    - Default (float): 0.1

Function Call Parameters:
- features: list of features detected per scene estimated from the feature detection module


Tool Example: 
Initialization: 
# Determine the detector that was used previously and initialize module with said detector

# Feature Matcher Module initialized with the SIFT detector
feature_tracker = FeatureMatchLightGlueTracking(detector='sift') # Initialized with detector 'sift' for proper matching

# Feature Matcher Module intialized with the SuperPoint detector
feature_tracker = FeatureMatchLightGlueTracking(detector='SuperPoint') # Initialized with detector 'orb' for proper matching


Example Usage in Script:  
features = feature_detector() # Call Feature Detector Module on image frames

tracked_features = feature_tracker(features=features) # Features used from Feature Detector Module are input to feature module

Tool Name: FeatureMatchSuperGlueTracking

Tool Description: 
Detects point correspondance across multiple frames for feature tracking in case of multi-view 
purposes. The feature matching algorithm used is the SuperGlue deep learning model trained 
as a feature matcher. Unless specified directly, assume the features are detected using 
the SuperPoint deep learning feature detector algorithm and initialize through the detector 
parameter. Use this matching module when features need to be matched in images where the 
scene contains low-lit enviornment or illumination changes occur in the scene 
(Outdoors for example), and run time is NOT A CONCERN, or when specified directly.
This matcher excels in Nighttime setting with SuperPoint as the detector, but other detectors
can be utilized for efficiency purposes.

Model is trained both for indoor and outdoor setting. When not specified, assume indoor
setting to properly initialize the model.

Other supported detectors are: SIFT and SuperPoint

Initialization Parameters:
- detector (str): Name of Feature Detector that was used to estimate the features provided.
- sinkhorn_iterations: number iterations for running the Sinkhorn Algorithm in the model for optimal
partial assignment of detected feature matches
    - default (int): 20
- match_threshold: confidence threshold (we choose 0.2) to retain some matches from the soft assignment
stage
    - default (float): 0.2
- descriptor_dim: the dimensions for the estimated desciptor generated from the detector used
    - default (int): 256
- setting: the string to determine if the images are "indoor" or "outdoor"
    - default (str): indoor

Function Call Parameters:
- features: list of features detected per scene estimated from the feature detection module


Tool Example: 
Initialization: 
# Determine the detector that was used previously and initialize module with said detector

# Feature Matcher Module initialized with the SIFT detector
feature_tracker = FeatureMatchSuperGlueTracking(detector='sift') # Initialized with detector 'sift' for proper matching

# Feature Matcher Module intialized with the SuperPoint detector
feature_tracker = FeatureMatchSuperGlueTracking(detector='SuperPoint') # Initialized with detector 'orb' for proper matching

Example Usage in Script:  
features = feature_detector() # Call Feature Detector Module on image frames

tracked_features = feature_tracker(features=features) # Features used from Feature Detector Module are input to feature module
