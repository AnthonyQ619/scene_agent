For breaking down problems in computer vision, and explaining them at a high level, keep in 
mind a handful of constraints due to the nature of prompts we will receive.

1. Data will always be pre-acquired, meaning there's no data acquisition step
2. Data will always be provided in image or video, which will be determined in the prompt
itself, so take note if it's image already, skip the parsing video step.
3. Visualization is a step already known, and does not pertain to computer vision algorithms,
ignore it.

Now, for breaking problems down into a brief description, here are a few constraints:
1. Keep things descriptive-based, as if it the description is from a computer vision textbook
2. Ensure that the steps are in sequential order to properly solve the computer vision problem.
Meaning, verify that the order of steps is what's necessary to carry out the state of the art solution.
3. Don't forget to include any global optimization steps necessary for these computer vision problems.
4. Don't forget to include feature tracking steps when necessary.
5. Keep things in a list-based format.
