Tool Name: CamPoseEstimatorEssentialToPnP

Tool Description: 
Estimates the camera pose for each frame in a set of images for a monocular camera. The
process of this module is to estimate the essential matrix for the first pair of images 
of the image set, recover the camera pose that's up-to-scale, then use the PnP algorithm
to estimate the rest of the camera's pose for each following images so each trajectory is 
in scale to the first pose estimation. Use this module for Monocular cameras that are 
calibrated for a given image set.

Initialization Parameters:
- calibration (Calibration): Data type that stores the camera's calibration data initialized from the 
calibration reader module
- image_path (str): The image path in which the images are stored and to utilize for scene building

Function Call Parameters:
- features_pairs (PointsMatched): Data Type containing the detected feature correspondences of image pairs
estimated from the feature matcher modules.


Tool Example: 
Initialization: 
image_path = ... # Path to set of images
calibration_data = CalibrationReader(calibration_path).get_calibration() # Used to get Calibration Data

CamPoseEstimatorEssentialToPnP(image_path=image_path, calibration=calibration_data) 

Function call:  
features = feature_detector() # Call Feature Detector Module on image frames

feature_pairs = feature_matcher(features) # Call Feature Matcher Module on detected features

pose_estimator(feature_pairs=feature_pairs) # Features used from Feature Detector Module

Tool Name: CamPoseEstimatorVGGTModel

Tool Description: 
Estimates the camera pose for each frame in a set of images for a monocular camera. The 
process of this module is to estimate the camera pose utilizing the Visual Geometry 
Grounded Transformer (VGGT) Model, a feed-forward neural network that directly infers 
all key 3D attributes of a scene, including camera parameters, point maps, depth maps, 
and 3D point tracks, from one, a few, or hundreds of its views. However, this module
only utilizes the pose estimation feature with intrinsic estimation. This module can estimate
the camera poses from just images alone, without features needing to be detected prior.

Utilize this module in cases where images do not have extreme overlap, scale is needed for a 
monocular camera setup, or runtime is not extremely necessary for computation.

Initialization Parameters:
- image_path (str): the image path in which the images are stored and to utilize for scene building
- calibration: Data type that stores the camera's calibration data initialized from the calibration 
reader module
    - Default (Calibration): None (assume's no calibration data, and will estimate in model instead)

Function Call Parameters:
- None


Tool Example: 
Initialization: 
image_path = ... # Path to set of images
calibration_data = CalibrationReader(calibration_path).get_calibration() # Used to get Calibration Data

# With calibration provided
pose_estimator = CamPoseEstimatorVGGTModel(image_path = image_path, calibration = calibration_data)

# Without calibration provided
pose_estimator = CamPoseEstimatorVGGTModel(image_path = image_path)

Function call:  
pose_estimator() # No Features used with this module
