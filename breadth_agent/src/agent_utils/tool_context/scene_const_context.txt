Tool Name: Sparse3DReconstructionMono

Tool Description: 
Sparsely reconstructs a 3D scene utilizing pre-processed information of camera poses and
detected features tracked across the scene. Camera Poses are estimated prior to thie module
through the camera pose estimation module. Features matched, or tracked are estimated 
prior to this module through the feature matcher module. 
This module can reconstruct sparse 3D scenes specifically using a monocular camera. This is 
determined by the data used and the parameter 'view' on module function call. 
This module can reconstruct sparse 3D scenes either through multi-view or two-view triangulation.
This is determined by the method used to find matching features. If features are detected from 
pairwise matching, use the "two" method for the 'method' parameter. If features are tracked
across multiple frames, use the "multi" method for the 'method' parameter.
Use this module when specified for sparse reconstruction and calibration data is provided,
with the camera being used is a monocular cmaera. This  module is for reconstructing the 
scene using the direct mathematical approach.


Tool Example: 
Initialization:
image_path = ...
calibration_path = ...
calibration_data = CalibrationReader(calibration_path).get_calibration()

sparse_reconstruction = Sparse3DReconstructionMono(calibration=calibration_data, image_path=image_path)

Function Use (multi-view):
feature_tracker = FeatureMatchLightGlueTracking(detector="superpoint")

cam_poses = pose_estimator(features=features) # To Estimate Camera Poses from detected features

tracked_features = feature_tracker(features=features) # To track features across multiple images 

# Estimate 3D scene using multi-view due to tracking features from multiple images in previous step
sparse_scene = sparse_reconstruction(tracked_features, cam_poses, view="multi") 

Function Use (two-view):
feature_matcher = FeatureMatchLoftrPair(img_path=image_path)

cam_poses = pose_estimator(features=features) # To Estimate Camera Poses from detected features

matched_features = feature_matcher(features=features) # To track features across multiple images 

# Estimate 3D scene using multi-view due to tracking features from multiple images in previous step
sparse_scene = sparse_reconstruction(tracked_features, cam_poses, view="two")
