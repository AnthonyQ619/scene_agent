# ### Description of Each Function:
# 1. **Load Stereo Image Pair**: Reads the left and right stereo images from the specified file paths.
# 2. **Convert Images to Grayscale**: Converts the loaded images to grayscale for easier feature detection.
# 3. **Detect Keypoints and Descriptors**: Uses the ORB feature detector to find keypoints and compute their descriptors.
# 4. **Match Features Between Left and Right Images**: Matches the descriptors from both images using the BFMatcher.
# 5. **Filter Matches**: Retains only the best matches based on distance.
# 6. **Estimate Disparity Map**: Computes the disparity map from the matched keypoints.
# 7. **Compute Depth from Disparity**: Calculates depth using the disparity map, focal length, and baseline.
# 8. **Estimate Camera Motion**: Estimates the camera motion based on depth information and matched keypoints.
# 9. **Track Frame Displacement**: Tracks the displacement based on the estimated camera motion.

# ### Note:
# - The camera motion estimation is simplified and would typically involve more complex calculations, such as using the essential matrix or other methods to derive rotation and translation.
# - Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`opencv-python` and `numpy`) to run this code.
