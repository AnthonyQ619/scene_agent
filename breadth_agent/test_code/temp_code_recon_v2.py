# Here's a structured implementation that addresses the sub-problems outlined in your dictionary. This code will perform Structure from Motion (SfM) using OpenCV and NumPy.

# ```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import os

# Step 1: Load Images and Calibration Parameters
def load_images_and_calibration(image_folder, calibration_file):
    images = []
    for filename in sorted(os.listdir(image_folder)):
        img = cv2.imread(os.path.join(image_folder, filename))
        if img is not None:
            images.append(img)
    
    # Load camera calibration parameters
    with np.load(calibration_file) as data:
        K = data['K']  # Camera intrinsic matrix
        dist_coeffs = data['dist_coeffs']  # Distortion coefficients
    
    return images, K, dist_coeffs

# Step 2: Feature Detection and Description
def detect_and_describe_features(images):
    orb = cv2.ORB_create()
    keypoints = []
    descriptors = []
    
    for img in images:

        keypoints.append(kp)
        descriptors.append(des)
    
    return keypoints, descriptors

# Step 3: Match Features Between Images

# Step 5: Triangulate 3D Points
def triangulate_points(poses, keypoints, matches, K):

        proj1 = np.hstack((R, t))

# Step 6: Bundle Adjustment (Placeholder)
def bundle_adjustment(points_3D, poses):
    # Placeholder for bundle adjustment implementation
    # This would typically involve optimization libraries like g2o or ceres-solver
    return points_3D, poses

# Step 7: Outlier Rejection with RANSAC
def ransac_outlier_rejection(matches, keypoints):
    # Placeholder for RANSAC implementation
    return matches

# Step 8: Generate Sparse 3D Reconstruction
def generate_sparse_reconstruction(points_3D, poses):
    # Visualize or save the sparse 3D reconstruction
    # Placeholder for visualization code
    print("Sparse 3D Reconstruction generated with", len(points_3D), "points.")

# Main function to execute the SfM pipeline
def run_sfm_pipeline(image_folder, calibration_file):
    images, K, dist_coeffs = load_images_and_calibration(image_folder, calibration_file)
    keypoints, descriptors = detect_and_describe_features(images)
    matches = match_features(descriptors)
    poses = estimate_camera_poses(images, keypoints, matches, K)
    points_3D = triangulate_points(poses, keypoints, matches, K)
    points_3D, poses = bundle_adjustment(points_3D, poses)

# Example usage
image_folder = "path_to_images"
calibration_file = "calibration_parameters.npz"
run_sfm_pipeline(image_folder, calibration_file)
# ```

# ### Description of Each Step:
# 1. **Load Images and Calibration Parameters**: Reads images from a specified folder and loads camera calibration parameters from a file.
# 2. **Feature Detection and Description**: Uses ORB to detect keypoints and compute descriptors for each image.
# 3. **Match Features Between Images**: Matches features between consecutive images using a brute-force matcher.
# 4. **Estimate Relative Camera Poses**: Estimates the relative camera poses using the essential matrix and recovers rotation and translation.
# 5. **Triangulate 3D Points**: Triangulates matched points to obtain their 3D coordinates.
# 6. **Bundle Adjustment**: Placeholder for optimizing the 3D points and camera poses.
# 7. **Outlier Rejection with RANSAC**: Placeholder for filtering outliers in the matched features.
# 8. **Generate Sparse 3D Reconstruction**: Compiles the 3D points and camera poses into a sparse reconstruction.

# This code provides a basic structure for implementing SfM and can be expanded with more sophisticated techniques for bundle adjustment and outlier rejection.
