    'Parse Video into Individual Frames': 'In this step, we will read the video file and extract each frame using a video processing library, storing them as images for further processing.',

    'Preprocess Frames': 'In this step, we will resize and normalize the frames to ensure consistency in size and lighting conditions, which is important for feature detection.',

    'Detect Keypoints and Descriptors in Frames': 'In this step, we will apply a feature detection algorithm (e.g., SIFT, ORB) to identify keypoints and compute their corresponding descriptors for each frame.',

    'Match Features Between Consecutive Frames': 'In this step, we will use a feature matching technique (e.g., FLANN or BFMatcher) to find correspondences between the descriptors of consecutive frames.',

    'Filter Matches': 'In this step, we will apply a filtering technique (e.g., ratio test) to retain only the best matches, discarding less reliable correspondences.',

    'Estimate Homography': 'In this step, we will use the matched keypoints to calculate the homography matrix that relates the two frames, typically using RANSAC to reject outliers.',

    'Warp Frames to a Common Perspective': 'In this step, we will apply the homography matrix to warp each frame to a common reference frame, ensuring alignment of overlapping areas.',

    'Blend Frames to Construct Mosaic': 'In this step, we will blend the warped frames together to create a seamless mosaic, using techniques such as feathering or multi-band blending to handle transitions.',

    'Post-process Mosaic': 'In this step, we will apply any final adjustments to the mosaic (e.g., cropping, sharpening) to enhance the visual quality of the final output.'
