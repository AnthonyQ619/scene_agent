    'Load Stereo Image Pair': 'In this step, we will read the two stereo images from the input using an image processing library to prepare them for feature detection and depth estimation.',

    'Convert Images to Grayscale': 'In this step, we will convert both images to grayscale to simplify the feature detection process, which helps in identifying keypoints effectively.',

    'Detect Keypoints and Descriptors': 'In this step, we will use a feature detection algorithm (e.g., SIFT, ORB) to identify keypoints in both images and compute their corresponding descriptors.',

    'Match Features Between Left and Right Images': 'In this step, we will use a feature matching technique (e.g., FLANN or BFMatcher) to find correspondences between the descriptors of the left and right images.',

    'Filter Matches': 'In this step, we will apply a filtering technique (e.g., ratio test or distance threshold) to retain only the best matches between the keypoints.',

    'Estimate Disparity Map': 'In this step, we will compute the disparity map using the matched keypoints, which helps in understanding the depth information between the two images.',

    'Compute Depth from Disparity': 'In this step, we will use the disparity map along with the camera parameters (focal length and baseline) to compute the depth of each corresponding point in the scene.',

    'Estimate Camera Motion': 'In this step, we will use the depth information and matched keypoints to estimate the camera motion (translation and rotation) between the two image pairs.',

    'Track Frame Displacement': 'In this step, we will calculate the frame displacement based on the estimated camera motion, providing information about how the camera has moved in the 3D space.'
