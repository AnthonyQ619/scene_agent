    'Load Stereo Image Pairs': 'In this step, we will read the left and right images from the two sets of stereo images using an image processing library to prepare them for disparity calculation.',

    'Convert Images to Grayscale': 'In this step, we will convert both the left and right images from each pair to grayscale to simplify the feature detection process.',

    'Compute Disparity Map': 'In this step, we will use a disparity estimation algorithm (e.g., StereoBM or StereoSGBM) to compute the disparity map from the left and right grayscale images, which will provide depth information.',

    'Calculate Depth from Disparity': 'In this step, we will convert the disparity map into depth information using the camera parameters (focal length and baseline) to understand the 3D structure of the scene.',

    'Feature Detection and Matching': 'In this step, we will detect keypoints in both left images using a feature detection algorithm (e.g., ORB, SIFT) and match the features between the two left images to track motion.',

    'Estimate Essential Matrix': 'In this step, we will compute the essential matrix from the matched feature points using the intrinsic parameters of the camera, which will help in estimating camera motion.',

    'Recover Camera Motion': 'In this step, we will decompose the essential matrix to recover the rotation and translation (motion) of the camera between the first and second image pairs.',

    'Track Frame Displacement': 'In this step, we will calculate the displacement of the camera based on the recovered translation vector, which indicates the motion between the two frames.'
