    'Load Images and Calibration Parameters': 'In this step, we will read the sequence of images and the provided camera calibration parameters to prepare for the Structure from Motion (SfM) process.',

    'Feature Detection and Description': 'In this step, we will apply a feature detection algorithm (e.g., SIFT, ORB) to identify keypoints in each image and compute their corresponding descriptors for matching.',

    'Match Features Between Images': 'In this step, we will use a feature matching technique (e.g., FLANN or BFMatcher) to find correspondences between the descriptors of the images in the sequence.',

    'Estimate Relative Camera Poses': 'In this step, we will estimate the relative poses (rotation and translation) of the camera between pairs of images using the matched feature points.',

    'Triangulate 3D Points': 'In this step, we will triangulate the matched feature points to obtain their corresponding 3D coordinates using the estimated camera poses and calibration parameters.',

    'Bundle Adjustment': 'In this step, we will perform bundle adjustment to optimize the 3D point positions and camera poses simultaneously, minimizing the reprojection error.',

    'Outlier Rejection with RANSAC': 'In this step, we will apply RANSAC to filter out outliers in the matched feature points and refine the camera pose estimations to improve the overall accuracy.',

    'Generate Sparse 3D Reconstruction': 'In this step, we will compile the optimized 3D points and camera poses into a sparse 3D reconstruction of the scene, visualizing the result for further analysis.'
